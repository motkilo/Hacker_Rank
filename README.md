# Hacker_Rank

This is just a repo for me store my solutions and for others to see how I write code and develop solutions to the challenges presented.

I try to include the instructions.pdf in each challenge folder as well so that anyone reviewing can see background context of the challenge and the requirements.

The code stored here is predominantly configured so that it is run on my machine and not on the code editors used in HackerRank. I have included line notes in the code to point out differences when possible.
